          <h1>Hello!</h1>
          <p>I'm Jon, and I'd like to formally welcome you to my gallery website! This is a collection of pretty much
            all my creative energy for the past year (but mainly my work for IMS322). Hope you enjoy looking through it!

          <h1>Art</h1>
          <p>I am an artist, who is thinking about specializing in character design. I find the process of designing
            characters really enjoyable, and like to think I'm pretty good at it. I'm constantly iterating on designs,
            as you can see below- I don't settle on a design until it's perfect.</p>

          <h1>Photography</h1>
          <p>Photography isn't really something I pursue. It's not a hobby or anything, though I do feel I have a bit of
            a knack for it. I think of it as a fun way to show my artistic abilities, and I enjoy doing it when I
            can.</p>

          <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
          <p>I started taking graphic design classes freshman year, and have really enjoyed them! Designing websites,
            posters, etc. has been a lot of fun, and it's something I've come to enjoy greatly. Hopefully you can see my
            passion for it reflected in my websites showcased here, and this poster I created for IMS254.</p>
