     <p>This is a hypothetical shop page for a website about weird pokemon plush toys. This assignment was really neat,
       because we barely did anything in html- we used javascript to print all the cards.</p>

       <p>Everything went very well with this assignment. I had no trouble at all implementing nearly everything I
         wanted
         to,
         and I thought I was being ambitious. Thanks to your help in class, I was able to make my border extend past the
         image without any difficulty. The one thing I was unable to do was the curved area behind the price, but I feel
         my project hasn't lost anything for it.</p>
