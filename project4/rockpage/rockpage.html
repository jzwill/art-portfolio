            <p>I'm Jon, and I'd like to formally welcome you to my gallery website! This is a collection of pretty much
              all my creative energy for the past year (but mainly my work for IMS322). Hope you enjoy looking through it!

            <p>I am an artist, who is thinking about specializing in character design. I find the process of designing
              characters really enjoyable, and like to think I'm pretty good at it. I'm constantly iterating on designs,
              as you can see below- I don't settle on a design until it's perfect.</p>
