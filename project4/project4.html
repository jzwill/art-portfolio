          <p>I'm Jon, and I'd like to formally welcome you to my gallery website! This is a collection of pretty much
            all my creative energy for the past year (but mainly my work for IMS322). Hope you enjoy looking through it!

          <p>I am an artist, who is thinking about specializing in character design. I find the process of designing
            characters really enjoyable, and like to think I'm pretty good at it. I'm constantly iterating on designs,
            as you can see below- I don't settle on a design until it's perfect.</p>

          <p>I started taking graphic design classes freshman year, and have really enjoyed them! Designing websites,
