  <h1>FAQ</h1>
  <p>For this assignment, we had to make a FAQ on a topic we were knowledgeable about. I chose character design because
    that's something I feel that I'm pretty good at.</p>

    <p class="answers" id="answer-1">To get started with designing a character, I often like to gather reference
      images from the internet. Pinterest is a good source of these, but you can really find them anywhere. Combining
      a bunch of images together to form an image board for the character can be very helpful as well. Having multiple
      references for design elements you'd like to integrate makes the process a lot smoother.</p>

    <p class="answers" id="answer-2">It can often be hard to come up with a character design. I recommend checking out
      sites like Pinterest for inspiration, you can scroll through endless ideas and it can help your thoughts start
      to form.

      <p>What's your process?</p>
      <h2 class="icon" id="icon-3">+</h2>
    </button>
    <p class="answers" id="answer-3">When designing characters, I like to start by envisioning their role and creating
      a moodboard of sorts. After that, I go and gather reference images from various sites, one for the pose and
      others for the design I envision. From there, I draw a featureless character as a base, and then construct my
      reference sheet.</p>

      <p>How do I take my designs to the next level?</p>
      <h2 class="icon" id="icon-4">+</h2>
    </button>
    <p class="answers" id="answer-4">The most important thing (to me) in leveling up your designs is to study real
      cultures and incorporate designs from them into your own. In a fictional setting, consider drawing inspiration
      from a particular era! Having a cohesive design sense between your characters really takes your designs to the
      next level.</p>

  <p id="documentation-text">I believe the design process for this project went very well. From the beginning, I
    had a
    general idea in
    mind
    for the layout, and I believe I executed it perfectly. Picking a topic I am interested in (character design)
    helped too, as I was able to give some informed tips that I feel are useful to the up-and-coming designer.
