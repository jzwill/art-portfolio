            <h1>Rocks</h1>
            <p>These models were created as my introduction to Mudbox, done as a way to familiarize myself with the basic functionality of the program. 
              I created their models entirely from scratch, utilizing the sculpting tools to form the shapes and apply finer details. 
              After that, I applied some basic paint layers to color the rocks, applying special attention to detail to create the rocky surfaces.

          <h1>Rock - High Poly</h1>
          <p>This rock model was created entirely from scratch in Mudbox, carved into a rocky shape using the program's sculpting tools. 
            It was then colored using the various paint tools in Mudbox, layered with multiple different colors to give it a chalky sort of rock effect.</p>

          <h1>Rock - Low Poly</h1>
          <p>This rock was far simpler than the other, with less time and effort spent on it, and not a lot of proper reference put in. 
            It looks alright, but it could be a lot better, and I'll be deleting it from my portfolio after this assignment gets graded.</p>
