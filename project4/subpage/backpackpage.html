            <p>This project was my first time UV Mapping in Maya, and the focus of it was to do just that. I added additional materials and created texture through the use of bump maps for final rendering.

          <p>Most of this project was just figuring out how UVs and materials work. Pretty basic stuff, but I'm happy with how it turned out. Good for an initial pass at the software.</p>
