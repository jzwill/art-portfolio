            <h1>Architecture Study</h1>
            <p>This was my first time really knuckling down and making a big complicated model with Maya. I mostly used bump-mapping, but the bricks were made and sculpted in Mudbox.

          <h1>Medieval Church</h1>
          <p>Modeling this building in Maya took a lot of time. I UV Mapped the entire thing, applying bumpmaps to specific parts of the geometry to create the stone effect. 
            After sculpting an individual brick in Mudbox, I created various combinations of the model grouped together in different rotations and layouts, to create a more varied effect when applied to the walls. 
            When grouped together, this creates variation while still looking somewhat identical, which was exactly what I wanted for this project.</p>
