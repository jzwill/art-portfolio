            <h1>Extinct Animal</h1>
            <p>This project, choosing an extinct species and creating a 3D model of it, was done entirely in Zbrush to familiarize myself with the software. 
              Again, I created the model entirely from scratch, molding the shape using Zbrush's various tools, and painting it in the software as well.

          <h1>Bonnerichthys</h1>
          <p>Unfortunately, my free trial of Zbrush ended before I could export the paint layers, so the turntable here is just the model work. 
            I made this before I really understood how edges and modeling really work in 3D, so there are quite a few problems.</p>
