            <h1>Organic Vegetation</h1>
            <p>I used a pre-made base model for this project so that I could primarily focus on UV Mapping, as I was still pretty new to it at the time of making this. 
              After completing the UV maps, I ported the model over to Mudbox to texture and paint it.

          <h1>Palm Tree</h1>
          <p>Though this project is mostly a base model, I was able to add some detail like the rings of the tree. This project was more about painting and texturing, and I believe I succeeded at that. 
            I'm especially proud of the waxy look for the leaves and the gentle sheen on the trunk.</p>
