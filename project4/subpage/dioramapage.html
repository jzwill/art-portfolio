            <h1>Environment Diorama</h1>
            <p>For this project, I combined most of the assets I had made earlier into one scene, while creating a few new assets to bring it all together.

          <h1>Diorama</h1>
          <p>I created the sand and rock models from scratch, and added starfish and seashell models which I found pre-made. I created custom textures and materials for each of these assets, then used bump mapping to add texture to the scene.
            The water was created the same way, and I feel like it's the highlight of the piece.
